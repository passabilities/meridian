// Live: an account that has spent its allowance for one model, in a pool with
// an account that has some left. Does a request for that model reach the
// second account, and does everything else stay on the first?
//
// It needs the real thing: two Claude Max profiles of the installed proxy,
// one whose weekly allowance for MODEL is spent (`/v1/usage/quota/all` shows
// that model's window at 100% while the account-wide windows have room) and
// one with allowance left. Nothing else makes Anthropic answer with the
// refusal this is about, so it cannot run in CI.
//

//
// The proxy is this checkout's, in this process, with a config directory, a
// session store and a working directory of its own: a proxy already running
// on the machine is not touched, and neither is its active profile. The two
// profiles' credentials are the installed ones, read where they are.
//
// MODEL is the model whose allowance is spent (default claude-fable-5-1) and
// OTHER_MODEL one the first account still serves (default claude-haiku-4-5).
// ALSO_SPENT, when set, is a second profile that refuses MODEL: with it the
// gate also asks a pool in which every account refuses.
// Costs four one-word replies: three of MODEL on ROOM, one of OTHER_MODEL on
// SPENT. The refusals themselves cost nothing.
