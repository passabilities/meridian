/**
 * Sticky session-to-profile routing (#383, design by @ShreeMulay).
 *
 * With multiple profiles configured, `routing = "sticky"` distributes
 * sessions across profiles while preserving session affinity — Anthropic's
 * prompt caching is per-account, so a session that flip-flops between
 * accounts pays a cold cache (full context re-creation) on every flip.
 *
 * Assignment uses rendezvous (highest-random-weight) hashing:
 *   - deterministic and stateless — stickiness survives proxy restarts with
 *     no persisted session→profile map to lose or corrupt
 *   - minimal disruption — adding an arm only moves the sessions that hash
 *     to the new arm; removing an arm only reassigns that arm's sessions
 *
 * Resolution priority (see resolveProfile): explicit x-meridian-profile
 * header > sticky assignment > active profile > config default > first.
 * Default mode is "active" (the pre-#383 chain) — existing setups are
 * byte-identical unless routing is explicitly enabled.
 *
 * This is a leaf module — no I/O. Most functions here are pure; the
 * exhaustion/assignment trackers below hold mutable in-memory state (by
 * design — see their own doc comments) but still perform no I/O.
